                <h4>What “country” are you allowed on?</h4>
                <p>
                    Although it is not obvious in the Northern Territory as there are not always fences, all the areas
                    of land have official ownership or management by an organisation or a group of people or person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can’t just wander off into “bush” and harvest items unless you have permission for whoever
                    manages the land. Every piece of land in the NT has a “tenure”. This means that it has someone who
                    oversees it and hopefully manages it. This may be Indigenous managed land, private land, local
                    council land, “vacant crown land”- which is managed by the government, NT Parks Land, Federal Parks
                    Land or leased land (from the government). Permission is needed from whoever manages the land to
                    harvest from it or go in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Foot note- It is also good to remember that only indigenous people were living on and with the land
                    220 years ago, and much of it was stolen. Even though now there are different tenures, each region
                    still has traditional owners who speak for that country and on which now other people may live.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <h4>Plant collecting “rules” </h4>
                <p>
                    If you are harvesting from the wild (with permission) to eat yourself, always remember that the
                    plants need to regenerate and that other animals rely on these foods. For this reason do not take
                    all the fruit, or if harvesting roots make sure there are other plants nearby to regenerate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Bush Tucker” has become very popular. If you are not harvesting just to eat yourself and wish to
                    sell the harvest plant parts or make these into something to sell you need a permit to do this. This
                    permit is obtained from Parks and Wildlife NT (insert link). Sometimes a royalty also needs to be
                    paid.

                <h4>Care when eating plants you are not familiar with </h4>
                <p>
                    If you are not familiar with particular plants you should not eat them.
                    Do not use this resource as a guide to go and find and eat plants. You should try and find someone
                    knowledgeable to teach you about identifying edible plants before you consume any.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember that some plants look similar and some plants can be poisonous.
